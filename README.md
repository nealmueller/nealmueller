# Hi, I'm Neal

I am a builder with product management roots, including work around teams and products connected to companies like Apple and Google. I like shipping small, useful software that solves everyday problems.

### Current projects

- **Gatewise**: airport leave-by-time planning so you know exactly when to head out
- **Summitbound**: a dungeon-style mountaineering game
- **Worthbar**: a Mac menu bar app that shows your Simplifi net worth at a glance
- **PhoneticAlfa**: phonetic communication utility
- **Landings**: web project focused on polished landing page experiences
- **CodexRunlight**: lightweight coding workflow tool

I care about clear product thinking, fast iteration, and kind collaboration. If you open an issue or PR, I will do my best to be responsive and helpful.
